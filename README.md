# Mappy

This project is inspired Tony Buzan (the inventor of Mind Mapping) and Kenneth Kufluk's [js-mindmap](https://github.com/kennethkufluk/js-mindmap) project. 
Kenneth developed an awesome script that builds single-page mindmaps using plain HTML. 
I built this app so anyone can create mindmaps using his library without authoring HTML. 
You can customize node colors, background color and download the entire map to use as you please.
